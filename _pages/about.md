Welcome!

I'm a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Political Science at Emory University. 

I broadly study how political participation and public opinion shape elite behavior in contexts, such as armed conflict, authoritarian consolidation, and foreign policy decision-making. My research develops along two complementary strands that together explore the political consequences of participation and public perception in contested settings. The first strand examines how elites respond to participatory signals, such as elections, even in high-stakes or repressive contexts. The second strand investigates how public opinion shapes elite behavior in the domains of counterinsurgency and foreign policy. 

I hold an MA and a BA in International Relations from Bilkent University (Turkey).
