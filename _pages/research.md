I study the impact of public opinion on counterinsurgency tactics. Specifically, I examine government efforts to avoid public backlash for counterinsurgency efforts both abroad and at home. In a secondary agenda, I study the interaction between domestic politics and foreign policy, emphasizing the role of domestic politics in foreign policy making.

<!-- - Constituents in Peril: How Political Channels and Public Services Influence Insurgent Tactics.
  -   <details>

        <summary>Abstract:</summary>
        Insurgents may risk their constituents' lives and protect themselves by conducting more indirect attacks against incumbent forces. Existing scholarship emphasizes the costs of civilian victimization on the responsible warring party. Extending this line of research, I ask under what conditions insurgent groups accept these costs, risking their own constituents' lives. I posit that insurgents employ riskier tactics that can put constituents' lives in danger when constituents are more likely to support the insurgency because of a lack of political channels and insufficient government public services. I test the implications of this theory using micro-level event data on construction and violence in Iraq from 2004 to 2009, survey data from Mosul after the city's liberation from the Islamic State, and cross-national data from over ninety conflicts from 1989 to 2013. I show that the increase in viable political channels, such as government centers or peace negotiations, exerts a substantial mitigating effect on the likelihood of insurgents engaging in indirect attacks within regions densely populated by their constituents. I also show that insurgents victimize civilians less when they do not provide public services better than the government. These outcomes highlight the broader significance of maintaining open political channels of communication with insurgent constituents and providing public services as the government, as they shape not only the relationship between the government and its citizens but also the dynamics between insurgent groups and their constituents. -->

- Pave the Way to Diversion: Increased Saliency of Foreign Policy at the Times of Economic Hardships. (with [Efe Tokdemir](https://www.efetokdemir.com/)).

        <summary>Abstract:</summary>
        Most studies in diversionary use of force literature focus on drivers (e.g., economic crisis, presidential approvals) and target selection (e.g., rivals, human rights abusers, etc.), yet treat the public as passive followers of politics, who are ready to consume with whatever they are fed. This paper strongly challenges the ``passive audience'' assumption and theorizes about the preconditions of diversionary use of force by building a bridge between the motivations and actions to divert. We argue that when leaders have incentives to resort to the use of force abroad for diversionary purposes, they first need to increase the salience of foreign policy issues in the public sphere to pave the ground for the public to take the bait. We test this argument in the context of the US, using a mediation model between economic difficulties and the use of force abroad through increased salience of foreign policy issues by collecting presidential speeches from 1945 to 2019. Our findings show that leaders do not treat the public as passive consumers, but attempt to shape their predispositions first to have them convinced about the policy. In so doing, our paper contributes to the diversionary use of force literature in both theoretical and empirical ends: we do not only advance the theoretical mechanism by arguing that leaders also need to prepare the public for their strategy, but also provide a more accurate test by adopting a mediation model instead of a moderation one in testing the novel theoretical mechanism.
